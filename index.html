            <p>Climate change is one of the greatest threats to humanity. All over the globe we are seeing and feeling the effects, faster, stronger and more often than than previously thought possible. A report by the United Nations' scientific panel on climate change released earlier this year expects our atmosphere - as of todays increase - to warm up by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040. Keep in mind that even the effects of a 0.5 degrees increase will have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html" target="new">severe consequences.</a> </p>
      
            <p>We are focusing on efforts that will make a change, both looking towards renewable energy and active C02 removal from the atmosphere. Join our small and growing community and be part of the movement, to help halt climate change. </p>
